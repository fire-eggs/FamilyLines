V0.5 was a "partial" release: several new features were "incomplete". 

# Use the new Fact/Event support in other places. See Merge, Export Places, Export HTML, Family Data grids, Statistics, etc.
# Complete the support for Fact/Event details (Age, Certainty, Notes, Images, etc)
# Rework Date-of-Birth and Date-of-Death as Events
# Submitter data should be stored in settings for later re-use.
# Use the Family Notes in other places: reports, ?
# Create new features/capabilities leveraging Facts, Events, or Family Notes.
# Create new "built-in" facts/events (e.g. genetics; non-Christian/Jewish events)
