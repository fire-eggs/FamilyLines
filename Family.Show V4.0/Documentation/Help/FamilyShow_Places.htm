<h1>Places Export</h1>
You can export place information to a Keyhole Markup Language (*.kml) file which is viewable in all modern mapping software.  One limitation is that only a place name string is exported, not full coordinates.  Any viewer software must know to do a search for a place because Family.Show cannot export coordinates.  Google Earth is one such viewer.  The exported file uses male/female iconography and separates the place information by births, marriages, deaths, cremations and burials.  It can produce informative representations of family migration and movements as shown in Figure 1 when you choose the option to export time information.<br/><br/>
